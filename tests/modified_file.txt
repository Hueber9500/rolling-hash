that template type deduction deduces the “wrong” types for 0 and NULL (i.e., their true types, rather than their fallback meaning as a representation for a null pointer) is the most compelling reason to use nullptr instead of 0 or NULL when you want to refer to a null pointer. With nullptr, templates pose no special challenge. Combined with the fact that nullptr doesn’t suffer from the overload resolution sur prises that 0 and NULL are susceptible to, the case is ironclad.
